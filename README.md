# HCI-projects
<p>Hello! This is my portfolio, which showcases a collection of projects I completed while working with clients or attending GA Tech (currently enrolled in the Master of Computer Science-HCI program). Each project highlights the skills, knowledge, and hands-on experience I gained while working on real assignments within my classes.
